# todo-list-python

This Python script implements a basic To-Do List application. It allows users to add tasks, view existing tasks, mark tasks as completed, and exit the application. The To-Do List application utilizes classes to represent tasks and a to-do list, providing methods for task management.

The main components of the code include:

- Task Class: Defines the structure of a task object with attributes such as name, date, hour, and completion status.

- ToDoList Class: Represents the to-do list, providing methods to add tasks, view tasks, and mark tasks as completed.

- Main Function: Implements the command-line interface (CLI) for user interaction. It prompts users to choose from various options (add task, view tasks, complete task, exit) and performs corresponding actions based on user input.

The code utilizes basic Python concepts such as classes, methods, loops, conditionals, and user input handling to create a functional To-Do List application. It can be further extended with additional features such as task prioritization, due dates, or file persistence for task storage.
